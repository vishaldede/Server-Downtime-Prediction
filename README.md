# ðŸ“Œ Server Downtime Prediction Project

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project predicts **server downtime** using synthetic data that mimics real-world server monitoring logs. It demonstrates a **full data science workflow** from dataset creation â†’ cleaning â†’ SQL analysis â†’ exploratory data analysis (EDA) â†’ machine learning â†’ model deployment using **Streamlit**.

This project is ideal for showcasing **data science, machine learning, and deployment skills** on a resume or portfolio.

## ðŸ”§ Steps in the Project

### 1. Dataset

* Used **5,000 records** of server logs
* Introduced messy data: missing values, inconsistent formats, categorical noise, outliers

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Removed duplicates
* Handled missing values
* Fixed wrong data types
* Standardized categorical values (`location`)
* Handled outliers (clipping, IQR method)
* Converted timestamps to proper datetime

### 3. SQL Analysis (MySQL)

* Stored dataset in MySQL database
* Wrote **6 SQL queries**:

  * Record counts
  * Avg CPU usage by location
  * Top 5 servers with highest downtime
  * CPU usage vs downtime
  * Network latency vs downtime
  * Most common location for downtime

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

* Used **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
* 6 key EDA questions with plots:

  * Downtime distribution
  * CPU usage distribution
  * Downtime by location
  * Network latency vs downtime
  * Correlation heatmap
  * Average CPU usage by downtime

### 5. Machine Learning Pipeline

* **Preprocessing:** Label Encoding, StandardScaler
* **Classification Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting
* **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
* **Clustering:** KMeans (Elbow Method for optimal k)
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV

### 6. Model Evaluation

* **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC + Cross-validation
* **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, RÂ² + Cross-validation

### 7. Deployment (Streamlit)

* Saved best model with `joblib`
* Built **Streamlit app** for interactive prediction
* User inputs: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network Latency, Location
* Output: Predicted **Downtime Likelihood** with probability
